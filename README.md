Object Oriented Programming Project in Java programming language

This Java code implements a simulation of a school environment using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This is one of the first projects I did in university, as part of the Object Oriented Programming class.It explores a multitude of Object Oriented Programming concepts, such as Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.

How to Run:

Compile the Java code: javac askisi4.java

Run the simulation with command-line arguments: java askisi4 [arguments]

Replace [arguments] with the necessary values for Cclass, Lj, Ls, Lt, and N
